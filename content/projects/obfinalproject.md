The internet can be a wonderful place, but it’s important to stay safe while using it. No matter where you are on the internet, there will always be people attempting to compromise your files, your personal information, and even your finances. Staying private on the internet might seem tricky at first, but it’s easy as long as you follow these tips:

## Tip 1: Think before you post

If the picture you’re about to share could reveal your full name, address, school, place of work, or any other personal information, then don’t post it. Remember, on the internet, anyone can see what you post, and you certainly don’t want the whole world to know where you live or work.

## Tip 2: Check your privacy settings

On websites such as Facebook and Instagram, by default, all of your posts are visible to everyone on the website. If you don’t want the whole world to see what you post online, make sure to change your visibility settings on social media to “private” or “friends only.” That way, you can control who sees what you post.

## Tip 3: Choose secure passwords

If your password is something easy to guess, such as “password123”, your own name, or your crush’s name, change it as soon as possible. Use a website such as https://www.useapassphrase.com/ to create secure passwords, and write them down in a safe place. Additionally, turn on two-factor authentication so that you can use your phone to verify your identity. That way, even if a hacker finds your password, they still won’t be able to access your account.

## Tip 4: Consider using a VPN

A VPN hides all of your online activity from anyone attempting to snoop on you, which is very useful when you’re in a public place, or a foreign country where a website that you use regularly is blocked. Don’t use “free” VPN services, as they are either very slow, store all of your activity, or both. Instead, use paid services such as Mullvad or ProtonVPN.

## Tip 5: Don’t trust shady websites

We’ve all been there: a website that claims to let you download the latest game, program, or movie for free, all while bombarding you with more ads than there are snowflakes in Antarctica. Here is a general rule of thumb for spotting scams: if it seems too good to be true, then it is. Don’t even touch these websites with a ten-foot pole, unless you like having viruses run wild throughout your computer. While we’re on the subject, get an ad blocker such as uBlock Origin to greatly lessen your chances of stumbling upon these types of sites.
