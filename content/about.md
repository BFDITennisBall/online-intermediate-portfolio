My name is Kyle, and I'm an [ICC](https://iccinc.org/) student-leader and aspiring web developer. Over the past couple of months, I've been on a journey to join ICC's Area Student Leader Team, or ASLT. Along the way, I've taken ICC's Online Basics and Online Intermediate courses to build my technical skills and better serve the role I play in ICC.

In Online Basics, I learned fundamental concepts of effective online communication, such as online privacy, email etiquette, and responsible social media usage. We also gave feedback on each other's projects, including our [final project](../projects/obfinalproject), which was to create a blog post, podcast, or graphic about a concept we learned in the course.

In Online Intermediate, we dove deeper into communication theory by learning about the Shannon-Weaver model of communication, and how the message we send is not always the message received. We also learned about different types of online content and social media, and how they appeal to different audiences. We also built our video editing skills by recording a [personal introduction](../projects/oipersonalintro), followed by an [educational video](../projects/oieducationalvideo.md) about an online communication topic.

Throughout Online Basics and Online Intermediate, I was reminded of the importance of how I should present myself online. If I wish to become an ASLT member, then I must be professional in the manner that I communicate with others online. Overall, I would recommend Online Basics and Online Intermediate to anyone who wishes to understand how to communicate more effectively on the internet. In the meantime, I will keep on building the skills I've learned so far, and continue to work towards becoming an ASLT member.
